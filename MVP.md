# Group Do: Designing your MVP

## Instructions
* With your group, answer each of the following questions:
  1. Who is your target audience?
     anyone who enjoys listening to music
  2. What is the problem that the product will address?
     seasonal depression
  3. What is the primary goal of the product?
     increase moods despite the weather
  4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
    - As a user I want the current weather in a zip code, so that I can listen to music based on the weather.
    - As a user I want pre-made playlists created, so that I don't have to decide on a song.
    - As a user I want to increase my mood with music and colors, so that I can relax.

* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.
